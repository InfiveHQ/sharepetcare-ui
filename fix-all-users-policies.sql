-- Fix ALL RLS policies for users table
-- This includes INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT operations

-- First, enable RLS
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop ALL existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all user names" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON users;

-- Policy for INSERT - allow authenticated users to create user records
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own profile" ON users
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy for UPDATE - allow authenticated users to update any user record
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON users
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy for DELETE - allow authenticated users to delete any user record
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" ON users
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Policy for SELECT - allow authenticated users to view any user record
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- This makes all operations permissive for authenticated users
-- Perfect for the sharing workflow where we need to delete placeholder users
