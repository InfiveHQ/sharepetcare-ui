DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view tasks for pets they own or have access to" ON pet_tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert tasks for pets they own" ON pet_tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update tasks for pets they own" ON pet_tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete tasks for pets they own" ON pet_tasks;

-- Create simple policies for pet_tasks (temporarily allow all access)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all for pet_tasks" ON pet_tasks
  FOR ALL USING (true);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view logs for pets they own or have access to" ON task_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert logs for pets they own" ON task_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update logs for pets they own" ON task_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete logs for pets they own" ON task_logs;
